Udacity Nanodegree - Popular Movies Stage 1


## Overview:
This application allows users to discover the most popular movies playing.
Upon launch, the user is presented with a grid arrangement of movie posters. 
Using the sort icon in the action bar, the user can choose to sort movies by
most popular or highest rated. The user can tap on a movie poster to see 
movie details. 


## API Key:
An API key for themoviedb.org is required to compile and run this application.
Once you've obtained your key, you will need to add it to app/build.gradle
under buildTypes. See example below, replacing `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with your key.

**app/build.gradle**
```
buildTypes {

  buildTypes.each {
    it.buildConfigField("String", "THEMOVIEDB_API_KEY", "\"<YOUR_API_KEY>\"")
  }

}
```
